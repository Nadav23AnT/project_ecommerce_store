# Synchronization

Synchronization is one of the biggest Issues in our projet we used  **Google Drive** and **GitHub** (Git) to collaborate with each other, and integrate easily into our workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.
